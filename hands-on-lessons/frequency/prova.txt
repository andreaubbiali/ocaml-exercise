Enter in wecode.sorint.it. Fork the repository universe/go-base, go to the settings of your forked repository and in the tab collaborators add me (aubbiali).


IN TERMINAL:
- start vpn
	sudo openfortivpn
- execute this command "kubectl port-forward service/postgres 6432:5432"

use postman to do this call. Set in the url the path written and if there is a body add in the 'body' tab the body written.


THINGS TODO:

- GetReservations()
	path: 			localhost:8080/reservations
	type:			GET
	behaviour: 		return all reservations in database
	
	
- CreateUser() (There is the first part of the api in the code.)
	path:			localhost:8080/user
	type:			POST
	behaviour:		continue the api, add the user into database
	body:
			{
				"Name": "Giulio",
				"LastName": "Paganoni",
				"Email": "gpaganoni@sorint.it"
			}
	
- CreateReservation()
	path:			localhost:8080/reservation
	type:			POST
	behaviour:		create the reservation. If the id of the user is 1 the field is_active must be true, false otherwise.
	body:	


			{
				"Description": "descrizione 4",
				"UserID": 4,
				"IsActive": true
			}



			
	improvements:		instead of control the id, if the user name is "Andrea" the field is_active must be true, false otherwise. 
					You have to use the same body request (need to get from db the users and check who is andrea).
	
IF YOU NEED SOME HELP LET ME KNOW.


For now if you want to do some practice on the project you can add others api to our project.
update user/delete user
update reservation/delete reservation

localhost:8080/edit_user

			{
				"ID": 10,
				"Name": "Gastone",
				"LastName": "Paperone",
				"Email": "gpaperone@topolinia.it"
			}

localhost:8080/delete_user/12

localhost:8080/edit_reservation

			{
				"ID": 5,		
				"Description": "brutta descrizione",
				"UserID": 11,
				"IsActive": true
			}
			
localhost:8080/delete_reservation/5
