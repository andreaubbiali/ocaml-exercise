(* 
A social network is a social structure made of individuals (or organizations) called nodes, which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of
interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, financial exchange, dislike, sexual relationships, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige.

A graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are 
represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges.

The exercise consists of:

  1-  implementing the social network as a graph, i.e., to define the graph data structure with the operations you consider necessary to implement a social network
  2-  implementing an operation that visits in a convenient way all the elements of the graph
  3-  testing it against a dummy social network.
