(* 
It is known that a welfare crook lives in Los Angeles. You are given lists
for 1) people receiving welfare, 2) Hollywood actors, and 3) residents of Beverly Hills.
The names in each list are sorted alphabetically (by < ). A welfare crook is someone
who appears in all three lists. Write an algorithm to find at least one crook
